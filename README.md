# Stand Up - Comedy Spots/Open Mic Events | iOS App


Problem: Although there were centralized events for big comedy shows in New York City, there was little to no coordination or advertising for young and rising stand comedians/open micers. 



Solution: I decided to create an app that list local comedy events in New York City to help both consumers and open micers know about potential spots and shows.
